# Build backwards so that the 32-bit version is available for the test-suite.
# Otherwise there are test failures because some tests preload a library
# to override the hostname. If the library is 64-bit then the test aborts
# when runtests.pl calls a 32-bit shell to spawn a sub-process.

# As of curl 7.61.1, Makefiles include macros over 8192 bytes long which our
# default make does not like. Ensure that GNU make is used for all invocations.
